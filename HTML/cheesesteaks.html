        <p>
          Before we find out where you can find the best Cheesesteak spots in Philly, lets learn a little bit about the history of the infamous
          sandwhich. It was in 1930 when a man named Pat Olivieri invented the cheesesteak. He was a hot dog vendor in South Philly who, as the story goes,
          decided to grill some beef from the butcher and put it on an Italian roll. Word about this inventive and delicious sandwhich spread, and pretty
          soon people from all over the city were coming to Olivieri to try his juicy sandwhich.

          <h3>Pat's King of Steaks</h3>
          <p>
            This brings us to the first authentic place where you can find a delicious cheesesteak. Pat Olivieri ended up opening his own cheesesteak shop called
            "Pat's King of Cheesesteaks" in 1830, and it is still packed with business to this day. Customers can pick from multiple different kinds of cheeseteaks,
            and can of course get their cheesesteak "wit or witout" cheese.

          <h3>Geno’s</h3>
          <p>
            Geno’s is located in South Philly at the intersection of 9th street and Passayunk avenue,
            ironically directly across the street from rival restaurant and first feature, Pat’s King
            of Steaks. Geno’s was established in 1966 by Joey Vento. After Joey’s death in 2011, the
            business was passed down to his son, Geno Vento. The inside of Geno’s is unique, it is
            decorated with memorabilia and hundreds of autographed and framed photos of celebrities
            who have eaten there in past years.

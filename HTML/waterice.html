        <p>
           Known in other states as “Italian Ice”, Philadelphians have seen their
           water ice as an iconic summer dessert or sweet treat to cool down during
           those scorching hot days. Most popular in Philadelphia and surrounding areas,
           there are two places in particular where people in Philadelphia love to go
           to get their favorite water ice treat.

          <h3>Philadelphia Water Ice Factory</h3>
          <p>
            Philadelphia Water Ice Factory opened its doors in the summer of 1988
            in the Port Richmond section of Philadelphia. The headlines read "you
            don't have to go to South Philly for great Italian Ice any more!" It
            was an instant success. Owners Ronald Kaleck and son Robert made all
            the products themselves, working from early morning to late at night.
            The Philadelphia Water Ice Factory serves a variety of flavors, ranging
            from the classic cherry and mango, to warheads super sour apple and pina
            colada. Located at 8354 State Road in Philly, this authentic philly shop
            place is a great place to get yourself some refreshing water ice!

          <h3>John's Water Ice</h3>
          <p>
            John’s water ice is a family owned and operated business since 1945.
            Just as founder John Cardullo hand cranked his water ice over 65 years ago,
            Anthony Cardullo, the third generation owner, uses only fresh fruit he
            personally selects and squeezes by hand, and adds only filtered water and
            sugar. John’s uses no preservatives or additives, giving you the most raw
            and fresh water ice a business could offer. Not only has John’s Water Ice
            won many local awards, they have also been featured on the Travel Channel
            and have served President Obama some cool water ice!

        <h1 align="center">Philly Soft Pretzels</h1>
        <p>
          While the stories vary, one source claims the first American pretzel was
          baked in 1861, about 75 miles west of Philadelphia in Lititz, Pennsylvania.
          As the tale goes, sometime around 1850, bread baker Ambrose Roth received
          the recipe from a hobo as a thank-you for a hot meal and some hospitality.
          Roth then passed the recipe on to his apprentice, Julius Sturgis who later
          established the country’s first commercial pretzel bakery. Because of the
          tight trading ties between Philadelphia and the areas in and around Pennsylvania
          Dutch Country, it was only natural that pretzels would seep into the city’s cuisine.
          Once cart vendors picked up on the potential of the salty treat, pretzels became
          a favorite of Philadelphians who, by the way, prefer them soft, chewy, and often
          topped off with a simple yellow mustard.

          <h3>Philly Preztel Factory</h3>
          <p>
            The first Philly Pretzel Factory opened its doors in Mayfair, Philadelphia
            in 1998. Their concept was to bake Philly style soft pretzels all day so
            that everyone could enjoy a soft pretzel that is served “Hot Outta the Oven”.
            Dan, one of the co-owners, started selling pretzels at the age of 11 on the
            corner of a busy intersection in Philly, and eventually him and his college
            roommate Len decided to open the first Philly Pretzel Factory in Northeast Philly.
            Today, the company is still growing and has locations in more than 12 states!

        <p>
          The Hoagie sandwich was originally created in Philadelphia. There are
          a number of different versions to how the Hoagie got its name, but no
          matter what version is right (historians cannot seem to agree on the
          correct version), all agree that it started in Philadelphia or the towns’
          suburbs. In 1992, the Italian Hoagie was declared the “Official Sandwich
          of Philadelphia”. Here are two great places to get a classic Italian Hoagie,
          as well as the many other hoagie options.

          <p>
            Campo’s is a family owned deli that has been around since 1947. It has
            always been a neighborhood local deli/grocery store, which they still

          <h3>Cosmi's Deli</h3>
          <p>
            Cosmi’s Deli was founded by Cosimo Quattrone, who was a native of
            Regae Calabria, Italy. Cosmio was an immigrant who had many jobs
            before finally opening his dream: Cosmi’s Supermarket &
            Grocery store at 1501 South 8th Street in 1932 in Philadelphia.
            Cosmi’s eventually earned the reputation as the “Mom and Pops
            supermarket”, people were stopping there from all over the area.
            Cosmi’s started making 20 different kinds of their famous hoagies
            in the 70’s and 80’s, and they haven’t stopped since.

      <p> The diverse cuisine of Philadelphia was shaped largely by the city's mixture
        of ethnicities and history. There are many different types of people that for
        generations have called Philadelphia their home, and with that comes the amazing
        variety of foods that the people of the city have to offer. There are certain
        foods that over time, have specifically become associated with the city of
        Philadelphia, the main four being cheesesteaks, hoagies, water ice, and the
        soft pretzel.

      <p>
        Of course there are many places in Philly where one can find and
        eat these four foods, however, there are a few places in particular that are
        specifically known for specializing in and serving authentic Philly cheesesteaks,
        hoagies, water ice, and soft pretzels. The goal of this website is to give you a
        guide to some of the most authentic places you can find the genuine foods that
        are associated with the city of brotherly love.
